# Bingo Drawer

A simple, accessible bingo number drawer. Set your highest number, draw without repeats, and see every draw highlighted on a clean grid. Great for quick games and group sessions.

## Key features
- Choose your range: set the maximum number to draw.
- One-tap draw: draws a unique number each time until the range is exhausted.
- Big reveal: a large, high-contrast overlay briefly shows the last drawn number for readability.
- Grid overview: drawn numbers are highlighted in the grid; undrawn numbers stay visible.
- Session control: reset with confirmation to start a fresh round.
- State persistence: your max, draws, and last number are restored after closing the app.
- Adaptive UI: works in light/dark themes; input hides after applying your max, reappears on reset.

## How to play
1) Enter the highest number you want to include (e.g., 70) and tap **Apply**.
2) Tap **Draw** to pull the next number. The overlay flashes the result; the grid highlights drawn numbers.
3) Tap **Reset** (and confirm) to clear the session and set a new range.

## Accessibility
- Large overlay for the last draw, with auto-sizing text.
- Clear grid highlighting for drawn numbers.
